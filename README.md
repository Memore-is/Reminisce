# Reminisce
**Reminisce** (v): The enjoyable recollection of past events.  

Because what are we, if not for our memories?


A personal weblog where I post poems, thoughts and other forms of creative writing.


Reminisce is a personal weblog where I will be posting creative writings (mostly poems) written by me. 
I made this project for the Athena Awards, and also because I like to write.
I didn't really struggle much with this project. But the hardest part would be getting the audio to work and formatting.
I learned how to better use flexboxes, and improved my beginner-level web-dev skills (by a lot).
