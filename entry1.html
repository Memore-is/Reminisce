    <div class="entry">
        I am from autumn days,
        With lazy winds
        That sings you back to sleep.
        
        I am from late night talks
        And evening walks,
        With everything in between.
        
        I am from summer nights
        With clear skies,
        And gentle river breeze.
        
        I am from rain and hail
        (The scary kind) â€”
        That brings story time and dreams .
        
        The pitter-patter,
        Puddle splatters,
        Who would've thought 
        That it would matter?
        That someday these would
        Only be memories 
        For me to keep.
