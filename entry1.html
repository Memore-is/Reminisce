I am from autumn days,
With lazy winds
That sings you back to sleep.

I am from late night talks
And evening walks,
With everything in between.

I am from summer nights
With clear skies,
And gentle river breeze.

I am from rain and hail
(The scary kind) —
That brings story time and dreams.

The pitter-patter,
Puddle splatters,
Who would've thought 
That it would matter?
That someday these would
Only be memories 
For me to keep.
