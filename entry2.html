Maybe all of it went well,
Maybe all of it went wrong,
Maybe someone forgot to ring the bells,
And that's why I'm writing this song.

Perhaps it is one,
Perhaps you'd disagree,
Well, apparently
Nothing stays the same.
You see —
All was meant to go well,
But did it actually?

And does it even matter,
If we'd only disagree?
Rules were meant to be broken,
Pages were meant to be torn.
None of this was supposed to matter,
Never matter at all.
